# Deep-Neural-Networks
Using Deep Neural Networks to solve problems of MNIST Classification (hand written digit classification) and Speech Denoising

Notebook **MNIST-Classification.ipynb** contains code which is used for training a Fully-connected Neural Network on MNIST training data
and then predict on test data. In this notebook, we also look at output from various layers to understand how neural networks construct 
different fetures for different classes, we also use PCA and t-SNE to visualize the features at different layers for different classes
